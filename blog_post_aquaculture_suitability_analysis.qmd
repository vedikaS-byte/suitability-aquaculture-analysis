# **Ocean Superfarms: Finding the Best Spots to Grow Seafood**

## **Purpose**

**GitHub Repository Link:**

There is a growing global need to sustainably feed expanding human
populations, and one promising solution is marine aquaculture.
Aquaculture is defined as the organized cultivation, feeding,
propagation, and production of aquatic organisms for commercial,
recreational, or public use (Alleway et al., 2018). The aquaculture
industry has significant potential to support food security while also
contributing to conservation and economic development. In California,
aquaculture is highly diverse in its production systems, cultured
species, and final products, accounting for approximately 6% of the
total value of the U.S. aquaculture industry (Wright et al., 2025).
Wright et al. identify four main sectors within California aquaculture:
finfish, shellfish, algae, and natural resource agencies. Finfish and
shellfish production together represent more than 70% of the industry’s
total value and primarily supply food for human consumption (Wright et
al., 2025). As a result, commercial aquaculture has become an
increasingly important and profitable source of marine food production
in California.

Oysters and the critically endangered red abalone are two commercially
significant species in California aquaculture. Oysters represent the
largest share of mollusk aquaculture production in the state, followed
by abalone, mussels, and marine clams, which together comprise the
remainder of California’s mollusk industry output (Wright et al., 2025).
Although oysters are relatively sturdy animals, they are sensitive to
environmental conditions and are typically confined to sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) between 11-30°C and water depths ranging from 0-70
meters below sea level (Oliver, 2025). The critically endangered red
abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*), a marine gastropod, thrives in cooler
SSTs of 8-18°C and is generally limited to depths of 0-25 meters below
sea level (SeaBase, n.d.). Both species are known to inhabit waters
along the U.S. West Coast. As such, identifying regions where their
suitable environmental ranges overlap within Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZs) may help evaluate potential areas for sustainable and profitable
aquaculture development.

The purpose of this blog post is to evaluate the suitability of West
Coast Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) for developing marine aquaculture
for multiple oyster species and the red abalone. Suitable locations are
identified using species-specific ranges of sea surface temperature
(SST) and ocean depth. This project utilizes GIS applications such as
working with vector and raster data, raster resampling, masking, and map
algebra to analyze environmental conditions. The analysis includes two
main components: (1) creating a final map of suitable oyster aquaculture
areas, and (2) building a function that allows users to generate
suitability maps by EEZ based on selected species, temperature ranges,
and depth limits. The following research question was utilized to
facilitate the analysis:

**How do changes in species-specific temperature and depth thresholds
affect the identification of suitable aquaculture areas within West
Coast Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) for commercially significant
marine species?**

### Data Description 

[SeaLifeBase](https://www.sealifebase.ca/search.php) is a publicly
available online database that provides information on a wide range of
marine species based on criteria such as commercial importance and
taxonomic group. Each species profile includes details on depth range,
temperature preference, geographic distribution, life history, and
classification. The database is open access and does not require any
downloads to use.

For this analysis, West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundaries
were obtained from [Marineregions.org](https://marineregions.org/) to
define maritime boundaries. The [General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans
(GEBCO)](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/#area)
is a global terrain model that provides geospatial information, such as
elevation, for both ocean and land surfaces at a 15-arc-second grid
resolution (GEBCO, n.d.). Bathymetry data for this analysis were
downloaded from GEBCO as a `tif` file. This analysis also used
satellite-derived average sea surface temperature (SST) data from
2008–2012 to characterize mean SST within each EEZ. Although the GeoTIFF
files were provided through course materials, the original data are
publicly available from [NOAA’s 5 km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface
Temperature Anomaly v3.1
product](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php).

## **Part 1: Map of Suitable Locations for Oyster Aquaculture**

### **Data Preparation**

Before beginning any analysis, it is necessary to load the appropriate
packages to properly read, manipulate, and work with geospatial data in
formats such as `sf`, `SpatRaster`, and `SpatVector`. The `vect()`
function was used to read in the West Coast EEZ shapefile as a vector
layer. The bathymetry dataset was imported as a raster using the
`rast()` function and stored as a `SpatRaster` object. For the SST data,
all `.tif` files were identified using `list.files()`, and the resulting
files were then combined into a single raster stack using `rast()` for
further analysis.

                        pattern = "average_annual", # File names matching pattern
                        full.names = TRUE) # Reference entire file names matching 
                                          # this pattern

# Stack all rasters
sst <- rast(sst_years)
```

It is critical to ensure that

3.  Pass conditional checks to transform any mismatching CRS for a
    spatial object to the reference CRS (`eez`) using `st_crs()`.

```{r}
# Create list of spatial objects
spatial_objects <- list(eez, depth, sst)

# Use eez's CRS as reference
ref_crs <- st_crs(spatial_objects$eez)
```

```{r}
# Check and transform each tile with if/else statements
if (st_crs(spatial_objects$depth) != ref_crs) {
  warning("depth CRS does not match. 
          Transforming to match eez CRS.")
  spatial_objects$depth <- st_transform(spatial_objects$depth, ref_crs)
} else {
  message("depth CRS already matches eez CRS.")
}
```

```{r}
# Check and transform each tile with if/else statements
if (st_crs(spatial_objects$sst) != ref_crs) {
  warning("sst CRS does not match. 
          Transforming to match eez CRS.")
  spatial_objects$sst <- st_transform(spatial_objects$sst, ref_crs)
} else {
  message("sst CRS already matches eez CRS.")
}
```

### **Data Processing**

The following steps to process the SST and depth data are required prior
to being combined.

3.  Reproject the depth dataset to match the SST coordinate reference
    system (CRS) so the layers align spatially and can be analyzed
    together accurately. Then, create a single raster of average SST
    from 2008-2012 using `mean()`.

```{r}
# Reproject to match sst CRS
depth <- project(depth, sst)

# Calculate average SST among all rasters
avg_sst <- mean(sst)
```

4.  Subtract 273.15 from the single average SST raster (`avg_sst`) to
    convert average temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius.

```{r}
# Update avg_sst in degrees Celsius
avg_sst <- avg_sst - 273.15
```

5.  Ensure that both rasters match in terms of their CRS, resolutions,
    and extents prior to cropping.

```{r}
# Do the CRS match?
message("Do the CRS match:", crs(avg_sst) == crs(depth))

# Do the resolutions match (require resampling)? 
message("Do the resolutions match:", res(avg_sst) == res(depth))

# Do the extents match?
message("Do the extents match: ", ext(avg_sst) == ext(depth))

```

6.  Crop the `depth` raster to match the extent of the `avg_sst` raster,
    then resample the cropped raster (`depth_sst_crop`) to match the
    resolution of `avg_sst` using the nearest neighbor method.

```{r}
# Use crop() to crop depth to the extent of avg_sst
depth_sst_crop <- crop(depth, avg_sst)

# Resample with nearest neighbor method
depth_sst_crop <- resample(depth_sst_crop, avg_sst, method = "near")
```

### **Finding suitable locations**

7.  Reclassify `avg_sst` and `depth` using a defined reclassification
    matrix for the oyster-specific SST and depth range in `classify()`.
    The reclassification matrix should set suitable values to `1` and
    unsuitable values to `0`.

```{r}
# Preferred oyster range for SST: 11-30°C

# Define reclass matrix for un/suitable SST
reclass_matrix_sst <- matrix(
  c(-Inf, 11, 0, # Negative infinity (unbounded) to 11 degrees assigned 0
    11, 30, 1, # 11-30 degrees assigned 1
    30, Inf, 0), # 30 to infinity (unbounded) assigned 0
  ncol = 3, # Create three columns
  byrow = T # Fill by row 
)

# Assign reclassified values to avg_sst
avg_sst_reclass <- classify(avg_sst, rcl = reclass_matrix_sst)
```

```{r}
# Preferred oyster range for depth: 0-70 meters below sea level

# Define reclass matrix for un/suitable depth
reclass_matrix_depth <- matrix(
  c(-Inf, -70, 0, # -70 used for values below sea level
    -70, 0, 1, # Suitable values assigned 1 for -70-0
    0, Inf, 0), # > 0 assigned unsuitable (0)
  ncol = 3,# Create three columns
  byrow = T # Fill by row  
)

# Assign reclassified values to depth
depth_reclass <- classify(depth_sst_crop, rcl = reclass_matrix_depth)
```

8.  Identify suitable (value = `1`) and unsuitable locations (value =
    `0`) for both reclassified SST and depth by defining a function that
    multiplies two rasters. Then, stack the reclassified layers with
    `lapp()` and apply the function to generate a combined binary
    suitability raster.

```{r}
# Create multiplication function to reference in lapp
multiply <- function(x,y){ 
  multi_raster <- x*y # Raster multiplication across all cells
  return(multi_raster)
  }
```

```{r}
# Return suitable (1) and unsuitable (0) cells 
avg_sst_depth <- lapp(
  x = c(avg_sst_reclass,depth_reclass), # Stack rasters
  fun = multiply) # Apply multiplication function 
```

### **Determine the most suitable EEZ**

In order to rank zones by priority, it was important to determine the
total suitable area within each EEZ. The total area of suitable
locations within each EEZ was calculated using the following steps.

9.  Project `eez` to match the CRS of `avg_sst_depth.`

```{r}
# Project
eez <- project(eez, avg_sst_depth)
```

10. Use `ifel()` to identify suitable cells within the West Coast EEZs
    by replacing values of `0` with `NA` (unsuitable) and converting all
    remaining values to `1` (suitable).

```{r}
# Select suitable areas
avg_sst_depth_suitable <- ifel(avg_sst_depth == 0, 
                               NA, # Replace with NA
                               1) # Otherwise assign "1"
```

11. Calculate the total suitable aquaculture area (km²) within each EEZ
    by masking, calculating cell areas, and summing suitable raster
    cells by region.

<!-- -->

a.  Rasterize each EEZ such that each pixel is labeled with its EEZ
    region. Rasterizing eez is crucial in this step because vector EEZ
    polygons are needed to operate in raster space so area can be
    summarized per region using raster-based functions (ex.`zonal()`).

```{r}
# Rasterize eez regions
eez_rast <- rasterize(eez, avg_sst_depth_suitable, 
                      field = "rgn") # By region
```

b.  Create a mask to keep only raster values inside EEZ boundaries and
    remove everything outside by setting it to `NA.`

```{r}
# Identify suitable cells in mask 
suitable_cells_eez <-  mask(avg_sst_depth_suitable, eez)
```

c.  Create a raster using `cellSize()` where each cell contains its
    surface area in km². Then, use `zonal()` to calculate the total
    suitable area within each EEZ by summing suitable raster cells areas
    by zone and joining the results to the eez_sf spatial data.

```{r}
# Calculate cell areas (km^2)
cell_area <- cellSize(suitable_cells_eez, unit = "km")

# Convert to sf object
eez_sf <- st_as_sf(eez) # To have geometry

area_eez <- zonal(cell_area * suitable_cells_eez, # Identify area of suitable locations 
                  eez_rast, # Rasterized eez
                  fun = "sum", na.rm = T) %>%  # Sum areas of cells within each EEZ zone 
  rename(suitable_area_km2 = area) %>% # Rename for naming conventions
  as.data.frame() %>% # Convert to data frame
  left_join(eez_sf, by = "rgn") # Join on region

# Convert back into sf so eez data (includes calculated suitable area) for mapping
area_eez <- area_eez %>% st_as_sf()

```

12. Use `tmap` functions to create a map of suitable area within each
    EEZ.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: 'hide'

# Create map
oyster_pref_map <- tm_shape(area_eez) +
  tm_polygons(
    "suitable_area_km2", # Color by suitable_area_km2 variable
    palette = "-mako", # Reverse blue scale
    style = "cont", # Continuous scale (styles referenced:
    #https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap-book/visual-variables.html)
    title = expression(
      "Suitable Area"~"("~ km^2~")") # Rename legend title
  ) +  
  
  tm_text("rgn", # Label by region
          size = .8, # Adjust size
          col = "white", # Adjust text color
          fontface = "bold",  # Labels are bolded
          xmod = -.5) + # Adjust .5 from the left
  
  tm_layout( # Center title outside bounding box
    main.title = "Marine Aquaculture Suitability for Oysters in West Coast EEZs",
     main.title.size = 1.5, # Adjust title size
    legend.outside = TRUE, # Place legend outside map frame
    legend.outside.position = "right", # Place legend to right
    component.autoscale = FALSE, # Disable autoscaling for title
    outer.margins = c(0.01, 0.25, 0.01, 0.05) # Manually adjust map frame
    ) + 
  
   tm_scale_bar( # Add scale bar for scale
     position = c(-.01, 0.08),   # Move 1% from left and 8% from bottom 
     breaks = seq(0, 500, 150)) + # Establish scale bar ranges

     tm_compass( # Add compass for orientation
     type = "4star",        
     position = c("right", "top")) + # Adjust position
  tm_basemap("Esri.OceanBasemap") # Ocean basemap


#oyster_pref_map
```

```{r}
#| output: false
# Save finalized map to figs
tmap_save(oyster_pref_map, filename = "figs/oyster_pref_map.png", width = 8, height = 10)
```

![](figs/oyster_pref_map.png) **Map 1. Finalized map of suitable
aquaculture areas within West Coast EEZs for oysters.**

13. Create a table using `kableExtra` to display both the total suitable
    area and the proportion of each EEZ that is suitable for oyster
    aquaculture, enabling comparison across regions independent of EEZ
    size.

```{r}
# Table with kableextra for prop of suitable areas to EEZ area
area_eez %>%
  st_drop_geometry %>%  # Drop geometry
  dplyr::select(region = rgn, # Select region
         suitable_area_km2, # Select suitable area
         total_area_km2 = area_km2 # Rename to total_area
         ) %>%   
  # Update suitable_area to be rounded to nearest hundreth
  mutate(suitable_area_km2 = round(suitable_area_km2, 2), 
         # Create new variable for prop of suitable area to total EEZ area
         percent_suitable = round((suitable_area_km2 / total_area_km2) * 100, 
                                  1)) %>% # Round to nearest tenth
  
  dplyr::select(-total_area_km2) %>% # Deselect total_area
  
  # Rename columns
  rename(
    "Region" = region,
     "Suitable Area (km^2)" = suitable_area_km2, 
    "Proportion of Suitable Area in EEZ" = percent_suitable
    )  %>%

  # Enable title
  kable(caption = "Amount of Suitable Areas by EEZ for Oyster Preferences") %>% 
  # Allow table to be striped with highlight option
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
                full_width = FALSE, # Disable full width 
                position = "center")  # Center labels
```

### Reflection

Central California is the most suitable EEZ with about 3,656.82 km^2^ of
suitable area while Northern California is the least suitable EEZ with
about 194.13 km^2^ of suitable area. Central California likely offers
the most favorable SST and depth conditions for oyster cultivation.
Notably, the Washington EEZ has a larger suitable area (1,028.90 km²)
than Northern California despite its colder location, indicating a
higher proportion of habitat appropriate for mollusk aquaculture.
Central and Southern California also show relatively high suitability.
Oregon’s EEZ contains substantial suitable area as well, though less
than most other regions.

## **Part 2: Generalized Function of Aquaculture for Species Preferences**

The `species_preference` function applies the generalized workflow
(Part 1) to streamline identification of suitable zones based on
species-specific sea surface temperature (SST) and depth ranges for any
species of interest. The function takes minimum and maximum SST values,
minimum and maximum depth limits, and a species name as inputs and
returns a map of EEZ regions shaded by total suitable area.

13. Verify coordinate reference systems (CRS) and load required spatial
    datasets before creating and running the function to ensure all
    spatial objects are correctly prepared for processing.

```{r}
#| output: false
#| code-fold: true
# Load in data again

# West Coast EEZ
eez <- vect(here::here("data", "wc_regions_clean.shp"))

# Bathymetry raster
depth <- rast(here::here("data", "depth.tif"))

# Create a list of the tiff files for SST
sst_years <- list.files(path="data/", # File path
                        pattern = "average_annual", # File names matching pattern
                        full.names = TRUE) # Reference entire file names matching
                                          #this pattern
# Stack all rasters 
sst <- rast(sst_years)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# Create list of spatial objects
spatial_objects <- list(eez, depth, sst)

# Use eez's CRS as reference
ref_crs <- st_crs(spatial_objects$eez)

# Check and transform each tile with if/else statements
if (st_crs(spatial_objects$depth) != ref_crs) {
  warning("depth CRS does not match. Transforming to match eez CRS.")
  spatial_objects$depth <- st_transform(spatial_objects$depth, ref_crs)
} else {
  message("depth CRS already matches eez CRS.")
}


# Check and transform each tile with if/else statements
if (st_crs(spatial_objects$sst) != ref_crs) {
  warning("sst CRS does not match. Transforming to match eez CRS.")
  spatial_objects$sst <- st_transform(spatial_objects$sst, ref_crs)
} else {
  message("sst CRS already matches eez CRS.")
}
```

14. Define the `multiply` function to support raster multiplication
    within the `species_preference` function when used with `lapp()`.

```{r}
# Define multiply function for global raster multiplication
multiply <- function(x,y){ 
  multi_raster <- x*y
  return(multi_raster)
  }
```

15. Create a function called `species_preference` that incorporates the
    Part 1 workflow to generate a map of suitable aquaculture areas
    within West Coast EEZs based on species-specific SST and depth
    parameters.

```{r}
# This function takes arguments:
# minimum and maximum sea surface temperature
# minimum and maximum depth
# species name

species_preference <- function(min_temp, max_temp, min_depth, max_depth, species_name){

### **Reflection**

The red abalone, a critically endangered marine gastropod, is a
commercially valuable species with strong potential for aquaculture. The
Washington EEZ appears especially promising for red abalone cultivation,
with more than 1,500 km² of suitable area, likely due to the colder
water temperatures preferred by the species. Interestingly, Central and
Southern California also contain substantial suitable areas that exceed
those of Northern California, despite their more southern and generally
warmer conditions; differences in coastal upwelling and nutrient
availability may help explain this pattern. Red abalone aquaculture also
represents a model for sustainable seafood production. For instance, the
Monterey Abalone Company in Central California raises abalone in both
marine and land-based systems with minimal use of chemicals and
antibiotics (Bailey, 2015). Overall, red abalone farms highlight
opportunities for environmentally responsible aquaculture while
supporting production in the most suitable West Coast EEZs, particularly
in Washington, Central California, and Northern California.
